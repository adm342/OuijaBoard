# OuijaBoard
Ouija Board App
Building a Ouija Board app that connects to DataBases that have information about fake people who died in them. Building the server to pull from that database, and the client will allow the user to input questions and get answers based on that database. Eventually I would like to use machine learning and AI to generate a random profile for the spirit instead.
